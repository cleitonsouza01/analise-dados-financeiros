# Finance Data Analysys
Coded by Cleiton Souza (cleitonsouza01@gmail.com)


## Purpose
 The purpose of this jupyter notebook is to demonstrate the use of Python to analyze financial data.
 This code demonstrates the capture of data, the analysis and calculation of financial indicators and the preparation of these data for use in modern prediction using Data Science techniques, as a neural network.

 In this code I am using bitcoin as an example, but the code can be easily changed to other types of assets like stocks, forex or options.
